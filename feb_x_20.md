# Software Team Meeting February 4, 2020
## Housekeeping
1. I've put the meeting notes up on GitHub, if you have anything you wish to reserve time to talk about during the meeting, clone down the repo and list it in the new "Before the Court" section.  Push it back up to the remote so I can have it listed before the meeting starts.
